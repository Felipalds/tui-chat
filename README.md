## Bubble Tea

> Bubble Tea programs are comprised of a model that describes the application state and three simple methods on that model:

- Init, a function that returns an initial command for the application to run.
- Update, a function that handles incoming events and updates the model accordingly.
- View, a function that renders the UI based on the data in the model.
